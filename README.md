An Investigation of the Pharmacogenomic Effects of a Chalcone Hit to Promote Resistance Against Oxidative Stress in Human WI-38 Cells

An analysis of a dataset that was developed by conducting gene expression profiling by high throughput sequencing. 
This dataset contained data from a human WI-38 fibroblast cell line treated with a chalcone that is hypothesized to promote resistance to hydrogen peroxide.
